# devOpsExercise

This is my take on the python cron job project found here https://github.com/DivvyPayHQ/devops-exercise#exercise-star-wars-cron-job-python 
I will continue adding to this readme as I go further in the project with instructions on setup/running the project. 


The Python part of this project is done! I may touch up/add some things to unittest, also potentially restructure apicall.py.

As of now the code fulfills the requirements. It digests the data in input.yaml, makes a call to the Star Wars API, then exports the requested data as json files into the users "Documents" directory
