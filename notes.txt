Exercise: Star Wars Cron Job (python)

Your company has tasked you with writing an background cron job. Input data has been provided as input.yaml.
Write a script in Python that will call out to the Star Wars API and gather information on each object in input.yaml.
The output should be in JSON format so that it can be ingested by another service, to be created in the future.
Write the output to a volume which survives the exit of the cronjob.


Some criteria for the project:


a .json file should be created for each object in input.yaml.
the naming convention should match <object.name>.json for each object.


Exercise: Containerization

Preperation
You should have docker, helm and minikube installed for this exercises.

Objective 1

Containerize the golang or python challenge in preparation to deploying it to Minikube

Dockerfile must be produced which will be used to build this container.
Container must run the executable from the Bears in the Forest challenge, or execute the python script in the Star Wars API challenge
For Star Wars API: Container must write the output json files to a volume which survives the exit of the container


Objective 2 (Helm)

Create a helm chart and use it to deploy the container (from part 1) to kubernetes (locally or to the instance made in the IaC exercise above)

Must include all necessary manifests to support the challenge container.
For Bears in the Forest: Must expose the challenge container HTTP service
For Star Wars API: Must me implemented as a cronjob which is set to run every hour
